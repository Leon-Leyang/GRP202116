## Overview

This is the Software Engineering Group Project, ’Flexible Data Annotation Tool for Machine
Learning Techniques’. It aims to develop a web based software which facilitates annotation
process for machine learning techniques. 

It utilizes training data to teach machines to complete work as people, machine learning (ML)
techniques are in great demand in Artificial Intelligent applications. Training data are
those data annotated by humans. Thus, being able to annotate a large amount of data
is of concern to modern deep learning based techniques.



## Getting Started

### Backend

+ You can directly use the jar files under the [deploy](./deploy/) directory.
+ Or use the source code under the [backend](./backend/) directory.
+ Build and run the backend in this order:
  + flask-server
  + eureka-server
  + sidecar-server
  + consumer-server

### Frontend

+ Inside the [frontend](./frontend/) directory, open the terminal and run:

```
## Project setup
npm install

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
npm run serve

### Compiles and minifies for production
npm run build

### Lints and fixes files
npm run lint
```
